#Error diagram  
- ETAS-conditional intensity(high lambda on the left: threshold of turning on the alarm)  
- tao is the fraction of time that the alarm is on for the threshold that we picked to turn on the alarm.   
- nu is evaluated at the event time(what proportion of the times that the intensity is greater than x)   
- instead of using lambda, we can look at window length  
- on error diagram, the window length increases  
- for a particular window length, lambda-a function of window function, adjusting for magnitude 
- Luen used tao=0.25

#Luen's code!  
- body wave magnitudes or other magnitudes: matters in the inmediate aftermath 
- said that using a general sense of magnitude is sufficient
- added some explanation on the code  
- "how did you inplement K that varies tao in the error diagram for MDA model"--Luen will write us back later after he looked more closely back on his code.  

#Why ETAS does better than MDA?  
- more components: which of the components has the most inpact on performing?  
- maybe the "summation thing" will be the key: can beat ETAS if you sum up the right tings  

#Approaches Luen suggested:  
- interpret as physics?  
- ETAS:complex  
- other models: complex but less complicated  
- Two approaches that we can take moving forward
- 1. cpome up with a function that is more complicated than MDA but less complicated than ETAS. Possibly do this by "summing over the right things"  
- 2. Soley focus on improving predictions (essentially predict earthquakes better than ETAS). May be more complicated than ETAS 

#linear programing problem or machine learning problem?  
- may be a lot of computational time on processing  
- not sure about human-power programing time  

#For future
- said that he will try to be in contact with us as we go through with him our various models/approaches
