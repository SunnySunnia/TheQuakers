* Error diagram  
--ETAS-conditional intensity(high lambda on the left: threshold of turning on the alarm)  
--tao is the fration of time that the alarm is on for the threshold that we picked to turn on the alarm.   
--nu is evaluated at the event time(what proportion of the times that the intensity is greater than x)   
--instead of using lambda, we can look at window length  
--on error diagram, the window length increases  
--for a particular window length, lambda-a function of window function, adjusting for mag  
--Luen used tao=0.25

* Luen's code!  
--body wave magnitudes or other magnitudes: matters in the inmediate aftermath  
--added some explanation on the code  
--"how did you inplement K that varies tao in the error diagram for MDA model"--Luen will write us back later after he looked more closely back on his code.  

* Why ETAS does better than MDA?  
--more components: whish of the components has the most inpact on performing?  
--maybe the "summation thing" will be the key: can beat ETAS if you sum up the right tings  

* Approaches Luen suggested:  
--interpret as physics?  
--ETAS:complex  
--other models: complex but less complicated  
--1. more complicated than MDA but less complicated than ETAS  
--2. just based on whatever improves prediction: maybe even more complicated  

* linear programing problem or machine learning problem?  
--may be a lot of computational time on processing  
--not sure about human-power programing time
