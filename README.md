==========
Iteration 1 Goals:
- To create a presentation that explains the ETAS model (you can see the presentation here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yf3W22eAIX-bPgmVdqkRFfsfIgCHmbtXclF3-S92Us8/edit?usp=sharing)

==========
SMART Goals:  
[S]pecific  
1. We will create a Google Presentation with slides that explain the 4 parameters of the ETAS model as presented by Professor Stark.  
[M]easurable  
1. The presentation will be 4-minutes long, comprising of about 8 slides.  
[A]ttainable  
1. You can view our presentation here:   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yf3W22eAIX-bPgmVdqkRFfsfIgCHmbtXclF3-S92Us8/edit?usp=sharing  
[R]elevant  
1. Understanding the ETAS model will help the class understand what the important inputs and parameters to earthquake modeling to consider.  
[T]ime-Bound  
1. We will have the presentation completed by 11:59pm 11/4/2013  

==========  
ROADBLOCKS  
1. The biggest and most obvious roadblock we've encountered is in the process of understanding the ETAS model itself, which is mathematically complex and sophisticated.   

However, we're overcoming this roadblock through the utilization of Luen's dissertation, as well as various papers by Ogata et al. A list of resources we've used can be found in our repo: https://github.com/SunnySunnia/TheQuakers
